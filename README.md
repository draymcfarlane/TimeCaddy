# TimeCaddy
Time management browser extension

To do:

Track:
- [ ] Pause tracking when the prompt that the tracking is finished appears.
- [ ] If the schedule tracking is selected, ensure that when the time is reached it only displays a message notifying the user that the time to use the website has passed the set schedule and that the tab would have to be closed. If the user wishes to disable the schedule on the site which isnt recommended for time management, they can do so through the manage section and searching for the website.

Manage:
- [ ] In the manage tab, when the category drop down is changed, it changes the time limit as well to what the category time limit is.
- [X] Allow time edit on bookmarked tabs, add a rerun button, a set timer that reads the system time and allows the user to set a specifc time to start and stop. (if the user is not in that specific tab at the time they set it at, prompt them at the time it notifies that the time is up, if they would like to extend it for that current browser session, but to not overrite current time preset).
- [ ] Add calender option in the schedule mode to visually allow the user to implement time, assist with agenda building.
- [ ] If the schedule mode is selected over the category mode, set the category as scheduled.
      
Categories:
- [X] Add a search bar that live displays its results as the user types.

Settings:
- [ ] Provide user configuration to how the extension looks.

Misc:
- [X] Initial release and bug fixing.
- [X] When the timer stops, the prompt should cover the entire specific tab with a slight transparent background. 
- [X] When the timer stops, ask the user if they would like to extend, stop or pause.
- [ ] Improve UI (WOP on Figma) (Design MindMap:

- [ ] Add option to sync calendar with outlook for better agenda building. Once synced, the scheduled websites should show up on Outlook's Calender as a appointment under either Busy or Free.
- [ ] Add a way for the extension to remember bookmarked tabs on next session.
- [ ] Upon opening the extension, have the Live tracker tab open, rather than having to click to open. (Might end up scrapping this idea, still debating)
