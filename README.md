# TimeCaddy
Time management browser extension

To do:
- [X] Initial release and bug fixing.
- [X] When the timer stops, the prompt should cover the entire specific tab with a slight transparent background. 
- [X] When the timer stops, ask the user if they would like to extend, stop or pause.
- [ ] Improve UI
- [ ] Allow time edit on bookmarked tabs, add a rerun button, a set timer that reads the system time and allows the user to set a specifc time to start and stop. (if the user is not in that specific tab at the time they set it at, prompt them at the time it notifies that the time is up, if they would like to extend it for that current browser session, but to not overrite current time preset).
- [ ] Add a way for the extension to remember bookmarked tabs on next session.
- [ ] Upon opening the extension, have the Live tracker tab open, rather than having to click to open.
